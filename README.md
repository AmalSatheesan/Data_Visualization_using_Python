The dataset includes the following variables:

Date: The date of the observation.
Recession: A binary variable indicating recession perion; 1 means it was recession, 0 means it was normal.
Automobile_Sales: The number of vehicles sold during the period.
GDP: The per capita GDP value in USD.
Unemployment_Rate: The monthly unemployment rate.
Consumer_Confidence: A synthetic index representing consumer confidence, which can impact consumer spending and automobile purchases.
Seasonality_Weight: The weight representing the seasonality effect on automobile sales during the period.
Price: The average vehicle price during the period.
Advertising_Expenditure: The advertising expenditure of the company.
Vehicle_Type: The type of vehicles sold; Supperminicar, Smallfamiliycar, Mediumfamilycar, Executivecar, Sports.
Competition: The measure of competition in the market, such as the number of competitors or market share of major manufacturers.
Month: Month of the observation extracted from Date.
Year: Year of the observation extracted from Date.
By examining various factors mentioned above from the dataset, you aim to gain insights into how recessions impact automobile sales for your company.


we are going to:
_1.Create Visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn & Folium_

1.1: Develop a Line chart using the functionality of pandas to show how automobile sales fluctuate from year to year.

1.2: Plot different lines for categories of vehicle type and analyse the trend to answer the question “Is there a noticeable difference in sales trends between different vehicle types during recession periods?”

1.3: Use the functionality of Seaborn Library to create a visualization to compare the sales trend per vehicle type for a recession period with a non-recession period.

1.4: Use sub plotting to compare the variations in GDP during recession and non-recession period by developing line plots for each period.

1.5: Develop a Bubble plot for displaying the impact of seasonality on Automobile Sales.

1.6: Use the functionality of Matplotlib to develop a scatter plot to identify the correlation between average vehicle price relate to the sales volume during recessions.

1.7: Create a pie chart to display the portion of advertising expenditure of XYZAutomotives during recession and non-recession periods.

1.8: Develop a pie chart to display the total Advertisement expenditure for each vehicle type during recession period.

1.9: Develop a countplot to analyse the effect of the unemployment rate on vehicle type and sales during the Recession Period.

_2.Create Dashboard using Plotly and Dash_

2.1: Create a Dash application and give it a meaningful title.

2.2:Add drop-down menus to your dashboard with appropriate titles and options.

2.3: Add a division for output display with appropriate id and classname property

2.4: Creating Callbacks; Define the callback function to update the input container based on the selected statistics and the output container.

2.5: Create and display graphs for Recession Report Statistics.

2.6: Create and display graphs for Yearly Report Statistics.
